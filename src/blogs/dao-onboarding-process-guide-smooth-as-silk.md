## What is an onboarding process? Why does it matter?
Let’s start by setting a frame and a context, an on boarding process is composed of all the elements in the pre joining, joining, integrating in the workflow the newcomer, and experience review phase.

Also, we experienced several onboarding processes, some of them we are aware of others are just routine, great on boardings invites people to recommend the organization and bring the best talent to the DAO.

## How does an onboarding process impact the people and DAO? 

Here We will find how a successful onboarding process makes the difference when it comes to getting tasks done and being part of a cohesive team that work towards the same purpose, the same mission, while sharing core values, this sets the difference between having tourist contributors and a cohesive team.

A good DAO culture, usually have an onboarding process able to integrate new teammates in the flow as smooth as possible and getting them on the day today flow, however this is not always the case but where there is something needed and missed there is opportunity, this means It is your time to build an onboarding process or enhanced it.

## Flipping established concepts.

Whether You have a traditional or unconventional background, You could find that in the web3 land, everything is being built from scratch and this process involves experimentation.

All of these experiments have their success or failure depending on a thoughtful person or team iterating over questions. Questions are at the root of web3, questioning established principles and moving the status quo.




# How to build a DAO onboarding process.
You usually start by running a set of questions to meditate about:

Which is the vision of the DAO?

What values define the community? 

Which is the purpose of the DAO?

How does the DAO culture look?

Once We have a set of answers about the DAO, the team, and the individuals, let’s build while having in mind the context it surrounds us in these three different levels.
Depending on your culture or purpose, adjust the process and the tools, however there are several points in the checklist you could implement.

Does there exist a public documentation, up to date where everyone can grasp the concepts straightforwardly? Where the links to official resources are accessible? Web page, forms, discord community, bounty board, and so on. If yes, continue to the next point. If not, start building the docs.

Are the people in the team accessible? Are they committed to the success of onboarding a new member? Or at least there is a team or someone guiding the new contributors in their discovery path? If this currently doesn’t exist, go through a small experiment of having an onboarding team or person and next show the result after a long enough amount of time.

The checklist to have in mind:
* Asking questions. Which values define the community? Which is the purpose of the DAO?
* Zoom out / the DAO. Zoom on / the team. Zoom in / the individual.
* Accessibility of the team, documentation, useful information and resources.
* Bounty board. Is it easily accessible?
* Discord channels organization.
* Creating community. Buddies or on boarders role. Town hall. 
* Write summaries about important information shared through an official channel.
* Review the process, get feedback and know the experiences of the newcomers.
* Iterate on the process.

Once you have gone through this checklist to have in mind and applied the concepts, matching your case and context with the parts are useful to the DAO, team and individuals, You are ready to go.

## How does it look like a real onboarding process? Hands on, full walkthrought, practical example.

Our practical example we will use the fictional name of:
DAO_Z.

Values: Badass people pushing the limits of what's possible, in the intersection of tech & design.
We know that DAOs can be the present of work, DAOs take down barriers of different types.
We match talent with bounties, and external opportunities in others DAOs and internal retributived tasks in our DAO_Z.
Our motto: Simple is better.

Flipping concepts: For our onboarding process we ship a skeleton concept enough to guide the community and encourage them to build muscles on top, with special emphasis on legs day.

The skeleton looks like this: The newcomers, “Phil web designer and Claire product manager”, fill a form with basic info about his / her skills, availability, discord handle, and other info of interest not less not more.

At the end of the form there is a link to the website, they take a look like what the are reading and next goto  the public docs in a github repository, where everyone can contribute to improve the documentation even non-developer, We have a guide on how to do contribute to the docs, the docs are based on markdown files.
The README markdown file has a table of contents pointing to all public info, which is up to date, here they find all about how to get started, mission, repositories, contributing guidelines, link to bounty board, how is organized the discord, persons of contact in discord by knowledge area, other key informations, and finally the link to the discord community.

Once the Phil and Claire  jump in the community the travel is straightforward:
Presentation in discord introduction channel.
A buddy is assigned to each of them, the buddy will help in the integration and answering any situational question that could arise.

Once is all going on, Phil and Claire has assisted to the weekly town hall and to the meetings with the team they were assigned to.
They start Contributing. We have a set of repositories for practice but overall We encourage, get into the real flow with the actual ongoing projects. They choose this second option.

So,Claire read about the past experiences in product management, We documented about and for the current project implement a set of guidelines based on the past experiences and having in mind the actual context, and for Phil We have some mockups ready for fill to transform into a website.

Phil who has also good skills at copywriting and some extra time, decide to take on the task of resume with notes each town hall and sent a weekly or by weekly newsletter.

Based on their experience after two weeks, with all the ins and outs plus the feedback they provide, We understand better what went well and what could be different and improve.
Claire decides to make a pull request in the docs in combination with the assigned buddy, a developer, and the docs get a new improvement.


### Conclusion:
Now you have the tools, build and ship it.
