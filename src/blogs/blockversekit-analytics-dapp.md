# BlockverseKit, discovering patterns at web3.

In today's news We are going to dive into, my usual day building.

## The best analytics dAPP, Blockversekit.

Since We are a small but great team, You will see a myriad of tasks related to different fields.

My tasks start:
1. Evaluating technologies: 

    Databases (e. g. We choose a db with support for time series data), hosting infrastructure and its security measures, front-end libraries, and the list continue.
2. Implementing the right tech:

    Having in mind the impact not only in the developer side with the current resources available but also in the scalability side, and overall how this improve the life of the persons that use our tools.
3. For non-dev area:

    I take care of twitter (loving it), organize the work to do (management) across the different areas, design figma mockups (quite an obsession) to have a reference before develop, write blog post (It feels as a corner stone) as this one.
