# Dumb ideas with potential V1

### The Macro Picture
**Code Garden:** 

A landscape of projects to flex my code muscles, and business skills.

It is good for portfolio, and to earn some coins.

Push technical features.

Run a set of web dev / design experiments.


### From Blog to Path Registry 

At the blog I like the simplicity of markdown so that's something to keep, easy format, without sparkly sparks.

However at Path Registry there will be some extra formats, experiments to run, test, iterate and laugh along the road.
