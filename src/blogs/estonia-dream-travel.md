# Estonia Dream Travel

It has been two years since I started researching about Estonia, and visualize myself travelling there, and who knows maybe living there at least for some time.
Let's start by doing some categories I will explore in this article: 
## Business, Society, Landscape.

I will do my best to find the balance between cons and pros, but be aware I love this country.


### In the side of business:
You will find the government has advocated since the beginning for an entrepeneur-friendly ecosystem, this means  good tax policies, events to attract investors, and startups, as well as companies, smooth ways to stablish your company.
All of that with a first digital mindset, and an effective education system, innovation at its core.
Back to entrepreneur and further... You will find a wide ecosystem with large players and companies. Estonia is the birth palce of 10 Unicorns, those companies valued at more than 1B...

Ok gotcha what else?

The tax system of estonia allows to attract foreign companies as well as establish companies there. In a combination of building unicorns, startups and raising money this is place to be if you are building or scaling your business or investments.

(Not financial advice)


While some people migth think: "This is one lucky strike", If you research,  You will find the numbers, and the statistics which is not the full picture but a clear one way to measure the succes of their strategies across years.
