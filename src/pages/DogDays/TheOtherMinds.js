<h1>The Other Minds</h1>
<p>
Finding the answers in nature
New science researchs show how the living beings are indeed intelligent, each one in their own form and with their own language or ways
<br/>
<br/>
In this great program by "El Cazador de Cerebros" where they talk with brilliant minds about different topics
<br/>
<br/>
There is one program that is a jewel it is called [Otras mentes](https://www.rtve.es/play/videos/el-cazador-de-cerebros/otras-mentes/6887708/), they talk about the intelligence of living beings as: parrots, dolphins, butterflies, slime and plants
**Highly recommended**
<br/>
<br/>
While some people already know this by intuition, now there are studies from new approaches to this matter, I think is important not all people have this natural intuition to understand nature
</p>
<br/>
<h2>The conclusion:</h2>
<p>
Humans are only another specie out there and not for it greater than the others
<br/>
<br/>
<em>PD: This season is unfolding with even greater discoveries and ways to understand the world</em>
