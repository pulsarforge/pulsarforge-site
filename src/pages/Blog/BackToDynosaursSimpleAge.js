<br/># Docusauring Docs back to its original form
<br/>
<br/>Sometimes you want to read docs with dark mode, other times you want to read docs without track all your clicks and breathings
<br/>
<br/>Let's travel to a time when dynos were dynos and not anything else, those simple times
<br/>
<br/>## Long story short
<br/>
<br/>To restore dynos to its original form
<br/>
<br/>1. You need to clone repo
<br/>2. Study, do notes, find and erase, while continously building
<br/>3. Check package json and note sketchy dependencies, search where it is used and erase, finally erase dependency
<br/>4. Study docusarus config js, erase miscellanous stuff
<br/>5. Navigate throught files at src folder, sketchy scripts erase
<br/>6. Check docs folder
<br/>
<br/>Now your work It is done
