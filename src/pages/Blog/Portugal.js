<br/># Portugal V1
<br/>
<br/>I was greatly surprised by how people is so respectful.
<br/>
<br/>## Lisbon
<br/>Landed:
<br/>-It is quite fresh.
<br/>
<br/>I didn't know yet the best part of the ocean wind, I will find it later on.
<br/>Taking the bus, random stop at the park Eduardo VII.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>-Look at those beauties.
<br/>
<br/>There were an event relate to books. The park has two long walking streets, at each side of each street, there were sites to buy books, almost all the same aesthetic, still with room to play.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>-Uhhhmmm... I like this form of books presentation, each site is quite similar therefore people focus in the books instead of shiny things.
<br/>
<br/>So much knowledge put me in alert state, my sense were awake, and suddenly I divised some "Pastelitos de Belem", the next I know? I was sitting, the sun temperature was nice, and my coffee was already gone, my mouth full of pastelitos, I barely stand up and continue my path in search of more knowledge.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>### Surroundings 
<br/>
<br/>I called that place "Praia Infinita"
<br/>Instead of going only to the fancy sites, It was also visited the 
<br/>
<br/>## Oporto
<br/>
<br/>A lot of sites to see the landscape, great views.
