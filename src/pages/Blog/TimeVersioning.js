<h1>Time Versioning Yourself</h1>
<p>

We usually use tech for external activities, store code, store data, track data, etc.

It is time to invert that and use tech to your own development.
<br/>
It is time to use the same abstractions, and visual cues to your own development.

</p>


<div>
<h3>Use git and github to time version yourself.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beliefs.</li>
<li>Inner identity.</li>
<li>Mental Models.</li>
<li>Biology stats.</li>
<li>Skills.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Using the same concepts of databases in your way to store your memories.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Json for unexpected data.</li>
<li>Cypher, for relations.</li>
<li>Tables for ordered data.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
Thinking in terms of charts, you can use data science notebooks, to get the real own analysis later on, and think in terms of extensions file for memories to store your data and access to it when needed.
Now attach to each related image/s and description/s that reference feelings, time, location, insights, and story attached to each unit.
<br/>
<br/>
What if you add some relation to each unit and start visualizing a force graph of your memories?
<br/>
What if you use visualization as a search engine?
Search and find related stored memories.
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>You get the point, feel free to share your insights to enhance memory and using technology to inner development.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Challenge:</h2>
<p>
1. What other abstractations or real tech you could use?
<br/>
2. Which combinations you could use? 
<br/>
3. How will look like that or those implementations?
