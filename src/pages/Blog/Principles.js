<h1>Principles</h1>

<h2>Metacognition, Empathy, Creativity</h2>
<p>
- Metacognition:
    Acccesing your mental models and their limitations
<br/>
- Empathy:
    Understand the thinking of others and how that helps to illuminate the gaps in your thinking, while enabling collaboration
<br/>
- Creativity:
    Ignite the imagination to come up with better answers
</p>
<h2>Impossible is nothing</h2>
<p>
  Impossible is the chance to change the world
</p>
<h2>Thinking One Step Ahead</h2>
<p>
  Redefine the game on your terms and creating your own path to success. It’s about taking a step back, understanding the broader context, and making moves others find hard to counter or they can’t or won’t do. When you understand why others do the things they do, you can choose to play a game they can’t play. 
  <br/>
  Only when you do something different you outperform the norm. Make your move
</p>
<h2>High standards</h2>
<p>
  I am not always at my best, but I always give my best
</p>
<h2>Showing up consistently</h2>
<p>
  For the long term, I am only as good as my consistency at hard and smart work
</p>
<h2>Competing against myself</h2> 
<p>
  You should outperform yourself at each iteration
</p>
<h2>Believing in the discipline of master what others have already figured out</h2>
<p>
  While interconnecting the knowledge, creating exponential points of connections across topics
</p>
<h2>Registering my path</h2>
<p>
  Reflecting from different points of views and frameworks, get new insights from the same experiences
