# Estonia Dream Travel

I started researching about Estonia a while ago, and visualize myself travelling there, and who knows maybe living there at least for some time.

## Business Ecosystem

Pretty damn awesome, it is thriving and people from around the globe are creating a wide range of business from small ones to unicorns, while using secure, enjoyable and all digital infrastructure, and yes, remote. 


## National Parks.
I like hiking so let the videos speak for themselves.
