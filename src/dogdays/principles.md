## Impossible is nothing
Impossible is the chance to change the world

## Think One Step Ahead
Redefine the game on your terms and creating your own path to success. It’s about taking a step back, understanding the broader context, and making moves others find hard to counter or they can’t or won’t do. When you understand why others do the things they do, you can choose to play a game they can’t play. Only when you do something different you outperform the norm. Make your move

## High standards
I am not always at my best, but I always give my best

## Show up consistently
For the long term, I am only as good as my consistency at hard and smart work
