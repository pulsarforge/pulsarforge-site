# Docusauring Docs back to its original form

Sometimes you want to read docs with dark mode, other times you want to read docs without track all your clicks and breathings

Let's travel to a time when dynos were dynos and not anything else, those simple times


## At the beginning

Dynos were dark by default eons pass and dark dynos live in peace

Until light dynos arrive, frying eyes, and imposing their ways
They have to constanly convince themselfs, they are civilized, and blablabla

( Pause to emoji them 🤣🤣🤣🤣 )


## Long story short

To restore dynos to its original form

1. You need to clone repo
2. Study, do notes, find and erase, while continously building
3. Check package json and note sketchy dependencies, search where it is used and erase, finally erase dependency
4. Study docusarus config js, erase miscellanous stuff
5. Navigate throught files at src folder, tra tra 🎵🎵🎵🎵, sketchy scripts erase
6. Check docs folder

Now your work It is done
