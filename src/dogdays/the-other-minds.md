# The Other Minds

Finding the answers in nature.
New science researchs show how the living beings are indeed intelligent, each one in their own form and with their own language or ways.

In this great program by "El Cazador de Cerebros" where they talk with brilliant minds about different topics.

There is one program that is a jewel it is called [Otras mentes](https://www.rtve.es/play/videos/el-cazador-de-cerebros/otras-mentes/6887708/), they talk about the intelligence of living beings as: parrots, dolphins, butterflies, slime and plants.
**Highly recommended**

While some people already know this by intuition, now there are studies from new approaches to this matter, I think is important not all people have this natural intuition to understand nature.

### The conclusion:
Humans are only another specie out there and not for it greater than the others.

<em>PD: 

This season is unfolding with even greater discoveries and ways to understand the world.</em>
